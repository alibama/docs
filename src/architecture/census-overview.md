# The Census

In Vocdoni, a census of identities is represented as a binary [Merkle Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree). The leaves of the tree contain the public key of all eligible voters, hashed.

```mermaid
graph TD;

Root-->H1
Root-->H2
H1-->H3
H1-->H4
H2-->H5
H2-->H6
H3-.->HashPubKey1
H4-.->Empty
H5-.->HashPubKey2
H6-.->HashPubKey3
```

A Merkle Tree allows to efficiently prove that a leave belongs to the tree. For a tree of size `N` elements, only `log(N)` elements are needed to generate a proof. As an example, a tree with 1 million leaves would only need 20 hashes to proove the inclusion of any leave.

The tree structure is made of nodes. Terminal nodes contain the actual values and the rest of them contain the hash of their two children. If a leaf is updated, all its parent nodes are affected.

+ The **verifier** only needs to know the Root Hash
+ The **prover** only needs to provide the Leaf and its Siblings

The owner of PubKey1 only needs `HashPubKey1 + H4 + H1` to prove anyone that the key is part of the Merkle Tree (census).

The verifier then will compute `hash( hash( hash(HashPubKey1) + H4 ) + H1 )` and compare the result with the Root hash that he/she already knows.

Vocdoni stores a hash of public keys instead of public keys themselves to provide an additional privacy layer when publishing the census.

### Census creation

Organizations have to publish their census before launching any governance process. Entities may have different policies to decide what users become part of a certain census.

The user registry is a private component used by entities to manage and generate census of voters. The registry may have a standard database with the private details of the entity's members and their public keys.

| id | name | age | country | pubkeyHash
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
| 0 | John | 27 | Winterfell | 0x123e...
| 1 | Tyrion | 36 | Lannisport | 0x567c...
| 2 | Daenerys | 22 | Dragonstone | 0xaabb...
| 3 | Jorah | 65 | Bear Island | 0xcc11...

When the entity wants to create a governance process, the administrator will use the registry to select the group of users matching a certain criteria. For example `age < 40`. The backend would select users `0,1,2` and create a Merkle tree with the corresponding public key hashes.

```mermaid
graph TD;

Root-->H1
Root-->H2
H1-->H3
H1-->H4
H2-->H5
H2-->H6
H3-.->0x123e...
H4-.->Empty
H5-.->0x567c...
H6-.->0xaabb...
```

### Exporting the census

The registry backend will finally:

+ Export the Merkle tree of pubkey hashes and make them available via IPFS or similar
+ Publish the Root Hash on the Process Smart Contract
+ Publish the IPFS URI of the Merkle tree on the Process Smart Contract

With the census details and the rest of parameters, a process is ready to be created by the manager.

### Accessing the census

The Gateways deployed by Vocdoni and third parties will be monitorizing the Process Smart Contract. As they see a new process and a census, they will fetch and import the Merkle Tree. At this point, users can use any available Gateway to check whether they are eligible for voting and then fetch their Merkle Proof.

Users with a valid Merkle Proof can efficiently show that their key belongs to a large census by providing a very small fraction of the whole tree.
